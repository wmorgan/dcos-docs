## Baby steps

It looks like you've just [installed](https://dcos.io/install/) DC/OS. Welcome aboard! Now that you have the DC/OS CLI set up on your local machine, you might be looking at the DC/OS Dashboard wondering, 'What now?'.

You probably already know how to use `docker run ...` to launch a web server, right? You can  do the same thing with DC/OS but in a way that is production ready, right off the bat. DC/OS will keep your application running if it crashes, and allow you to scale it, update its config at runtime and much more!

Ready? Let's launch a production-grade containerized web server with this command from the DC/OS CLI:

    $ dcos marathon app add https://dcos.io/docs/latest/usage/nginx.json

Now go to the DC/OS Dashboard and open the Marathon service. You should [see](img/usage_marathon_webserver.png) the web server up and running and ready to serve traffic.
