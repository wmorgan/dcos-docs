DC/OS provides a number of tools out of the box for service discovery and load balancing. Here's an overview of the options, with some general guidelines on what to use in which situations.

| Tool | Type | When should I use it? |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [VIPs][1] ([Minuteman][2]) | Minuteman is a layer 4 load balancer, which can be used for most TCP traffic for any Mesos task within a DC/OS cluster. | When you have internal-only TCP services which do not require layer 7 features. |
| [Marathon-lb][3] | Marathon-lb is an HAProxy based load balancer for Marathon only. | When you require external routing or layer 7 load balancing features. Examples of layer 7 features include: TLS termination, zero-downtime deployments, HTTP sticky sessions, load balancing algorithm customization, network ACLs, HTTP basic auth, gzip compression, and more. |
| [Mesos-DNS][4] | Mesos-DNS is a basic DNS-based service discovery tool that works with any Mesos task. | When neither VIPs or Marathon-lb are adequate, you can use the auto-generated [Mesos-DNS names][5]. For example, to discovery Marathon-lb you'd use Mesos-DNS by connecting to Marathon-lb with `marathon-lb.marathon.mesos`. Or, if you have UDP services such as StatsD. |
