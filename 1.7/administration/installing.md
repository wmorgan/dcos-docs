The DCOS Community Edition (CE) is available to try for free on supported cloud providers by using DCOS cloud templates. The templates are a JSON-formatted text file that describes the resources and properties.

The DCOS Enterprise Edition (EE) provides everything you need to run DCOS at scale in production. You can run on premise, in a cloud environment, or in a hybrid environment using both cloud and on premise infrastructure.
