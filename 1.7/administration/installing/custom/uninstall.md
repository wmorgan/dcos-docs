You can uninstall DC/OS from each node individually or from all nodes at once.

## Uninstall all nodes
   
You can completely uninstall DC/OS from all of your nodes by using this method. You must have installed DC/OS via the CLI or GUI installer to use this method.
   
From the bootstrap node, enter this command:

```bash
$ sudo bash dcos_generate_config.sh --uninstall
```

Here is an example of the output:

```bash
Running mesosphere/dcos-genconf docker with BUILD_DIR set to /home/centos/genconf
====> EXECUTING UNINSTALL
This will uninstall DC/OS on your cluster. You may need to manually remove /var/lib/zookeeper in some cases after this completes, please see our documentation for details. Are you ABSOLUTELY sure you want to proceed? [ (y)es/(n)o ]: yes
====> START uninstall_dcos
====> STAGE uninstall
====> STAGE uninstall
====> OUTPUT FOR uninstall_dcos
====> END uninstall_dcos with returncode: 0
====> SUMMARY FOR uninstall_dcos
2 out of 2 hosts successfully completed uninstall_dcos stage.
====> END OF SUMMARY FOR uninstall_dcos
```

Uninstall individual nodes

You can uninstall DC/OS from individual nodes by using this method.

From each node, enter these commands:

```bash
$ sudo -i /opt/mesosphere/bin/pkgpanda uninstall
$ sudo rm -rf /opt/mesosphere /etc/mesosphere
```

**Tip:** Uninstalling DCOS with these commands does not delete everything on the host.
