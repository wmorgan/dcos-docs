Containerizers allow you to run tasks in containers. Running tasks in containers offers a number of benefits, including the ability to isolate tasks from one another and control task resources programmatically.

DC/OS supports the Mesos containerizer types [DC/OS Universal container runtime](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/containerizer/#Mesos) and [Docker containerizer](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/containerizer/#Docker).

**Important:** This feature is considered [experimental](/docs/1.8/overview/feature-maturity/#experimental): use it at your own risk. We might add, change, or delete any functionality as described in this document. We encourage [feedback from the DC/OS community](https://dcos.io/community/).

# DC/OS Universal container runtime

The [Universal container runtime](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/container-image) extends the Mesos containerizer to support provisioning [Docker](https://docker.com/) and [AppC](https://github.com/appc/spec) container images. This means that you can use both the Mesos containerizer and other container image types in DC/OS. While other containerizers still play well with DC/OS, the Universal container runtime does not depend upon other container technologies and can therefore take advantage of more Mesos features.

The Universal container runtime offers the following advantages:

* **Removes your dependency on the Docker daemon**: With previous versions of Docker, if the Docker daemon was not responsive, a restart to the daemon caused all containers to stop on the host. In addition, Docker must be installed on each of your agent nodes in order to use the Docker containerizer. This means that in order to use the Docker containerizer you need to upgrade Docker on the agent nodes each time a new version of Docker comes out.
* The Universal container runtime is more stable and allows deployment at scale.
* The Universal container runtime offers features not available in the Docker containerizer, such as GPU and CNI support.
* The Universal container runtime allows you to take advantage of continuing innovation within both the Mesos and DC/OS, including features such as IP per container, strict container isolation and more.

## Provisioning Docker or AppC Containers with the Mesos Containerizer

To run Docker or AppC containers with the Universal container runtime, specify the container type `MESOS` and a `docker` or `appc` object in your [Marathon application definition](http://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/application-basics.html).

The Mesos containerizer provides a `credential`, with a `principal` and an optional `secret` field to authenticate when downloading the Docker or AppC image.

```json
{
	"id": "mesos-docker",
    "container": {
		"docker": {
			"image": "mesosphere/inky",
            "credential": {
				"principal": "<my-principal>",
                "secret": "<my-secret>"
			}
		},
		"type": "MESOS"
	},
	"args": ["<my-arg>"],
    "cpus": 0.2,
    "mem": 16.0,
    "instances": 1
}
```

For the moment, you can only use these features of the Mesos containerizer via a JSON app definition, not through the DC/OS web interface.

# Docker Containerizer

Use the Docker containerizer if you need specific features of the Docker package. To specify the Docker containerizer, add the following to your Marathon application definition:

```json
{
	"id": "docker",
    "container": {
		"type": "DOCKER",
        "docker": {
			"network": "HOST",
          	"image": "<my-image>"
        }
    },
    "args": ["<my-arg>"]
}
```
