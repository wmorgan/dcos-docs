## Finding your public addresses

The DC/OS AWS CloudFormation template creates 1 Mesos agent node
in the [public zone][1] by default, which is also fronted by a public ELB.

To find your public ELB hostname and public agent IPs:

1.  Find your [Amazon EC2 Management](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home) page.

2.  Navigate to the **Load Balancers** tab, which you can find on the left panel under **Load Balancing**.

3.  Search for your cluster name in the search bar, and select the ELB that contains the name "Public". The ELB hostname is visible under the "DNS Name".

    In this example, the DNS A record is `brenden-l-PublicSl-1CE9GBJKVK1NZ-1614104872.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com`.

    **Tip**: You should always use the DNS A record, rather than pointing directly to an IP, unless you attach an elastic IP. To use your own hostname with the ELB, create a CNAME record that points to the ELB A record.

4.  Click on the **Instances** tab to view the list of instances in the LB pool. All instances should be listed with a status of "InService".

5.  To view the public IP, click on one of the instances and look in the lower pane for the public hostname and IP.

    In this example, the public IP is `54.187.143.120`.

## Scaling an AWS cluster

The DC/OS AWS CloudFormation template is optimized to run DC/OS, but you might want to change the number of agent nodes based on your needs.

**Important:** Scaling down your AWS cluster could result in data loss. It is recommended that you scale down by 1 node at a time, letting the DC/OS service recover. For example, if you are running a DC/OS service and you scale down from 10 to 5 nodes, this could result in losing all the instances of your service.

To change the number of agent nodes with AWS:

1.  From [AWS CloudFormation Management][3] page, select your DC/OS cluster and click **Update Stack**.
2.  Click through to the **Specify Parameters** page, and you can specify new values for the **PublicSlaveInstanceCount** and **SlaveInstanceCount**.
3.  On the **Options** page, accept the defaults and click **Next**. **Tip:** You can choose whether to rollback on failure. By default this option is set to **Yes**.
4.  On the **Review** page, check the acknowledgement box and then click **Create**.

Your new machines will take a few minutes to initialize; you can watch them in the EC2 console. The DC/OS web interface will update as soon as the new nodes register.

## Upgrading a DC/OS cluster in AWS

You can update an existing DC/OS cluster or services to use the latest DC/OS template.

To upgrade a DC/OS cluster:

1.  Create a new DC/OS cluster by using the latest [DC/OS template][2] for AWS.

2.  Migrate your active DC/OS services and apps to the new DC/OS cluster:

    1.  Migrate, Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) the app data to the new cluster.

    2.  Migrate your DC/OS services and apps to the new cluster.

    3.  Change the DNS so that it points to the DC/OS services running in the new cluster.

3.  Shutdown your existing DC/OS cluster.
