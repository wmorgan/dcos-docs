# DC/OS documentation contribution guidelines

## Styling and formatting your contribution

- Use [GitHub-flavored markdown](https://help.github.com/enterprise/11.10.340/user/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).

- Use relative links.

- Begin all links at the root `docs` level and include the version number subdirectory. (e.g., `/docs/1.8/administration/sshcluster/`).

- Each directory must contain an `index.md` file. This acts as the base-level topic for each folder in the site (required).

- Do not include file names in your paths. Our site converts any files not named `index.md` into directory names. For example, the directory `/docs/1.8/administration/` contains a file named `user-management.md`. To link to this content on the live site, you would use the following path: `/docs/1.8/administration/user-management/`.

- The table of contents of each page is automatically generated based on the top-level headers.

- Directory tables of contents are automatically generated based on `post_title` (or `nav_title`) and `post_excerpt` headers.

- Use active voice whenever possible.

- Use sentence-style capitalization for headings.

## Making your contribution

### Modifying the content

1. Create a [JIRA issue](https://dcosjira.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa) and select **docs** as the component.

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [dcos-docs](https://github.com/dcos/dcos-docs) repo (you only have to do this once).

1. Clone your fork of the [dcos-docs](https://github.com/dcos/dcos-docs) repo.

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/<your-user-name>/dcos-docs
    ```

1. Create a branch on your fork using your JIRA number as the name.

    ```bash
    $ git checkout -b dcos-nnn
    ```

1. Create your content. In most cases you should be able to create your content within the existing directory structure. 

    - To create a single page:
        1. Create a markdown file `{post_slug}.md` where `post_slug` is your file name. File names become URIs. If you want this page to be a child of another page, place the `.md` file in the parent folder.
        1. Add your page content, including the required metadata `post_title` and optional `nav_title` and `menu_order`. Do not include any other metadata.
        
               ```
               ---
               post_title: The Title
               ---
               Post markdown goes here.
               ```
    - To create a page with hierarchy:
        1. Create a new directory in the appropriate location of the correctly versioned release (e.g., `/1.8/foo`) and a child page within this folder named `index.md` (e.g. `/1.8/foo/index.md`). The actual URI of your page will be `/1.8/foo/`, not `/1.8/foo/index`. For example, if it's a tutorial for 1.7, create a new directory here `/1.8/usage/tutorials/foo/`.
        1. Add your page content, including the required metadata `post_title` and optional `nav_title` and `menu_order`. Do not include any other metadata.
                
               ```bash
               ---
               post_title: The Title
               ---
               Post markdown goes here.
               ```

    - **Tips:** 
        * Check the `templates` directory to see if there is a template that corresponds to the type of content you are creating. For example, if it's a tutorial you can copy [templates/tutorial.md](templates/tutorial.md) into `foo/` and rename it to `foo/index.md`. Adapt the sections in your new `foo/index.md` to the specifics of your content.

        * Add images in a child `foo/img/` directory.  

        * Include all required assets in your `/foo` directory, for example, Marathon app spec, JSON docs, or a Dockerfile.

        * If you're unsure about what exactly should go into a tutorial, you can always check out [spark/](/docs/1.8/usage/tutorials/spark/) for reference.

1. Push your changes into the feature branch of your remote.

    ```bash
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Addresses issue DCOS-nnn"
    $ git push origin dcos-nnn
    ```

### <a name="test-local"></a>Building and testing your content locally

We've implemented the [dcos-docs](https://github.com/dcos/dcos-docs) repo as a [submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) of the [dcos-website](https://github.com/dcos/dcos-website) repo. Before submitting your pull request against the [dcos-docs](https://github.com/dcos/dcos-docs) repo, fork the parent [dcos-website](https://github.com/dcos/dcos-website) repo and build the site locally. This will allow you to confirm that your content renders correctly and that all of your links work. 

1. Make sure you have the following: 
    - [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
    - [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
    - [Node](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)

1. Clone the dcos-website repo.

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/dcos/dcos-website
    ```

1. Check out the develop branch.

    ```bash
    $ git checkout develop
    ```

1. Initialize the dcos-docs submodule with the content from the upstream master.

    ```bash
    $ git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

1. Replace the content from the upstream master with the content from your local dcos-docs repo using one of the following methods.

  - Delete the `dcos-website/dcos-dcos` directory and replace it with a symlink to your local `dcos-docs` repo. For example, if your directory structure is `/projects/dcos-website` and `/projects/dcos-docs`, you can issue these commands from the `dcos-website` directory:

     ```bash
     $ rm -r dcos-docs
     $ ln -s <local-path-to-dcos-docs> dcos-docs
     ```
  - Copy the contents of your local dcos-docs repo into the `/dcos-website/dcos-docs` folder.

     ```bash
     $ cp -rf ~/dcos-docs ~/dcos-website/
     ``` 

1. Make sure npm is up-to-date and install dependencies. 
    
    ```bash
    $ sudo npm install npm@latest -g
    $ npm install
    ```

1. Launch the local web server to view your changes.

    ```bash
    $ npm start
    ```
    
### Submitting your pull request

1. When you're done, submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) against the [dcos-docs](https://github.com/dcos/dcos-docs) repo.

1. Add a link to this PR in your [JIRA issue](https://dcosjira.atlassian.net/).

For all contributions that include hands-on instructions, such as found in `usage/` or `administration/`, the community managers will test-drive and validate before merging. They might come back to you asking you to fix things. All communications should take place within your pull request on GitHub.
